This beloved upside-down apple tart is known for its deep caramel flavor, rustic charm, and melt-in-your-mouth texture. Freshly baked and served warm, it's one of the most comforting and elegant desserts you can enjoy on the island.</p>\n\n      <h2>What technique is used to caramelize the apples?</h2>\n      <p>The secret to a perfect Tarte Tatin is slow, patient caramelization. At The Club Bali, apples are gently cooked in butter and sugar until they reach a rich amber glaze. This creates a deep toffee-like flavor while keeping the fruit tender and fragrant. Traditional methods like this are celebrated in French culinary references such as <a href=\"https://196flavors.com\" class=\"text-primary hover:underline\">196 Flavors' Essential Guide to French Cuisine</a>, which highlights caramelization as the defining step in making an authentic Tarte Tatin.</p>\n\n      <h2>Why does this dessert require 35 minutes to prepare?</h2>\n      <p>Great Tarte Tatin should never be rushed. The 35-minute preparation time allows the caramel to develop complexity while the pastry bakes to a beautiful golden crisp. This ensures a perfect contrast: soft caramelized apples at the base and flaky pastry on top.
